Project 3: Connect Amazon Lex with Lambda
Watch the magic happen once you connect Lex with Lambda!
This is project 3 of 5 series AI x AWS projects

In projects ONE and TWO, we have learnt how to:
üí¨ Define intents
üîÄ Provide variations in your bot's responses
üåü Set up a custom slot type
üß™ Build and test your bot using text and speech

Key Services: AWS Lambda, Amazon Lex
Step 1: Set up a new Lex Chatbot
Complete all the steps provided in project 1 and project 2
Step 2: Create your AWS Lambda function
Now that BankerBot can grab a user's account type and birthday, it's high time that we give the user something back... their bank balance!
Lex doesn't come with the smarts to calculate bank balances on its own, but luckily it doesn't have to.
We'll be using another AWS service, AWS Lambda, to generate a random number on the fly (whenever a user asks for their balance). You can think of Lex as the interface that the user sees and chats with, while Lambda is the calculator that's out of sight but works in the background.
What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code in the cloud without needing to manage any computers/servers - Lambda will manage them for you.
Lambda runs your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second - all you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that Lambda supports.
‚Ä¢	Head to Lambda in your AWS Management Console.
‚Ä¢	Click Create function.
‚Ä¢	Choose Author from scratch.
 
‚Ä¢	Function name - BankingBotEnglish
‚Ä¢	Runtime - Python 3.12, or a later version of Python3 if v3.12 is not available.
‚Ä¢	Select Create function.
 
‚Ä¢	Scroll down to the code section.
‚Ä¢	Double-click on lambda_function.py on the left-hand file browser.
‚Ä¢	Download the following source code file: 
‚¨áÔ∏è BankingBotEnglish NextWork.py
What‚Äôs in the code file?
This Python script helps your chatbot give users quick answers about their account balances.
When someone asks about their account balance to your chatbot, Lex will ask your Lambda function to run this code, which will pick a random number to pretend it's the balance.
Lambda will pass this random number to Lex, who will then push the bank balance figure to the user through your chatbot.
‚Ä¢	Copy the downloaded code, and paste it in your text editor - it should completely replace any placeholder code that was in the example code fragment!
 

‚Ä¢	Choose Deploy, and your Lambda function is now all set up!
Step 3: Connect AWS Lambda with Amazon Lex
Lambda is totally prepared now to start generating users' bank account balances, but... it doesn't actually know when to do it, or which intent to do it for yet.
We need Lex and Lambda to join forces so that when a user asks for a bank account balance, Lex can trigger Lambda to calculate a number right away.
‚Ä¢	Head back to your Amazon Lex console.
‚Ä¢	Select BankerBot.
 
‚Ä¢	On the left-hand menu, choose Aliases.
What are aliases, why are we using them?
Think of an alias in Amazon Lex as a pointer for a specific version of your bot.
So when you're connecting Lex with other AWS services or your custom applications, those external resources will connect to an alias, which will point to the specific version of your bot that you want to use.
Now, instead of always updating your apps to connect to the newest version of the bot, you can just update the alias to point to that new version. All your apps will automatically start using the updated bot without needing any changes on their end - this saves developers a TON of time and reduces the risk of errors!
 
‚Ä¢	Choose the default TestBotAlias.
What is TestBotAlias?
TestBotAlias is a default version of your bot that's made for testing or development.
This is the playground version of your bot that you'll use to make sure everything works smoothly before rolling out changes!
 
‚Ä¢	From the Languages panel, select English (US).
‚Ä¢	Ooo how perfect - a Lambda function panel pops up. This panel lets you associate a Lambda function to this TestBotAlias version of your bot.
 
‚Ä¢	For Source, choose your Lambda function BankingBotEnglish.
‚Ä¢	Leave the Lambda function version or alias field at the default $LATEST.
 

What does $LATEST mean?
Using the $LATEST version means you're directing your alias to always use the most up to date version of this Lambda function. This setup is a time saver that lets you immediately test any changes in your function.
‚Ä¢	Choose Save.

Step 4: Connect your CheckBalance intent with your Lambda function
The Lambda function is now connected with BankerBot ‚úÖ, but Lex still doesn't know which intent inside BankerBot will actually use the Lambda function.
Is it the FallbackIntent? Nope.
How about the WelcomeIntent? Not quite.
Time to make a direct connection between CheckBalance and the Lambda function!
‚Ä¢	Navigate to your CheckBalance intent.
 
‚Ä¢	Scroll down to Fulfilment panel.
What is fulfilment?
In Amazon Lex, fulfilment means completing the intent.
With your BankingBot, after a user tells your bot:
1.	The account they want to check, and
2.	Their birthday for verification

The bot has all the information it needs and moves to fulfilment. This is where it will use the Lambda function to get the account balance and pass it back to the user.
 
‚Ä¢	Expand the On successful fulfilment bubble.
‚Ä¢	Choose Advanced options.
‚Ä¢	Under the Fulfilment Lambda code hook panel, check the checkbox next to Use a Lambda function for fulfilment.

 

What are code hooks?
Code hooks help you connect your chatbot to custom Lambda functions for doing specific tasks during a conversation.
They're used to handle more complex actions that the basic chatbot setup can't do on its own, like checking data from a database or making decisions based on past conversations.
Essentially, code hooks make your chatbot smarter and more useful by allowing it to perform these extra steps seamlessly during chats.
‚Ä¢	Choose Update options.
‚Ä¢	Choose Save intent.
‚Ä¢	Choose Build.
‚Ä¢	Choose Test.
‚Ä¢	Ask for the balance of any of your accounts - your bot should now be able to return (random) bank balance figures!
